## Project Motivation <a name="motivation"></a>

This repository is for Udacity's Data Science Nanodegree blog post project, and the subject is COVID-19 cases in California. I chose this subject because of its ubiquitous and far-reaching impact on our daily lives, and I sought to answer the following questions:
* How are overall cases and deaths related?
* Do deaths have any relationship between the number of ICU cases?
* What is the relationship between the number of suspected cases and the number of actual cases?

## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

Older versions of certain packages may work, but have not been tested.
* Anaconda distribution of Python (>=3.5)
* pandas (>= 1.0.0)
* NumPy (>= 1.0)
* JupyterLab (>= 1.0)
* plotly (>= 4.7.0)
   - The JupyterLab extension should also be installed, as detailed [here](https://plotly.com/python/getting-started/#jupyterlab-support-python-35).

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

A JupyterLab notebook is included that describes the entire process of gathering, cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing the data, along with the original dataset and an accompanying codebook.

## Results <a name="results"></a>

The corresponding Medium blog post, which summarizes and describes the main findings of this project, can be found [here](https://medium.com/@jrtran/covid-19-in-california-a-county-by-county-overview-eee334f8a159).

## Licensing, Authors, and Acknowledgements <a name="licensing"></a>

The licensing for the data is included in the JupyterLab notebook. Udacity's Data Science Nanodegree course provided the template for this README.
