    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "California has emerged as a hotspot for COVID-19 cases, leading to extensive, high-profile efforts to stem the virus' spread. However, policymakers continue to grapple with the Golden State's substantial size and diversity; sprawling metropolitan areas may see their hospitals straining for resources as deaths rise, while less populated regions could experience unnecessary economic devastation, given their relatively low mortality and infection rates. Therefore, the goal of this study is to provide a county-by-county overview of California's COVID-19 figures, paying particular attention to the following questions:\n",
    "* What is the relationship between the overall number of cases and the number of serious/fatal cases? \n",
    "* What is the relationship between the number of suspected cases (including symptomatic patients awaiting test results) and the number of actual cases?\n",
    "* Can we accurately predict total deaths for a particular day, given the number of cases?\n",
    "\n",
    "These questions may help us better understand how restrictions should be formed for each county, as well as an estimation for the medical severity of COVID-19 itself."

    "## 2. Data Source and Description\n",
    "The data came in a CSV file and was acquired on May 16, 2020, from the [California Human Health and Services Agency data repository](https://healthdata.gov/dataset/california-covid-19-hospital-data-and-case-statistics). It contains the day-by-day count of COVID-19 cases, arranged by county and several other dimensions: whether the case required ICU treatment, whether the case was suspected or not, and the number of total deaths. This data was reported from April 1, 2020, to May 15, 2020 (totals before April 1 were unavailable). The following columns are available from this dataset (descriptions largely taken, with minor modifications, from the accompanying codebook, also found in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/jrtran/DS_Blog_COVID)):\n",
    "* County Name: County for which case statistics or hospital data were reported. \n",
    "* Most Recent Date: The date for which case statistics and hospital data were reported.\n",
    "* Total Count Confirmed: Cumulative number of laboratory-confirmed positive COVID-19 cases as reported by local health departments.\n",
    "* Total Count Deaths: Cumulative number of COVID-related deaths as reported by local health departments. It is expected that, to be counted, COVID is the cause of death or at least a contributing factor to the death. COVID-related deaths are also counted in \"Positive Cases\".\n",
    "* COVID-19 Positive Patients: Number of laboratory-confirmed positive COVID-19 patients that are in hospitals TODAY.  This is not a cumulative number.  This includes emergency department, ICU, Telemetry, and Med/Surg patients, but not affiliated clinics or outpatient department patients.\n",
    "* Suspected COVID-19 Positive Patients: Number of symptomatic patients, with tests for COVID-19 pending laboratory confirmation, that are in hospitals TODAY.  This is not a cumulative number.  This number includes emergency department, ICU, Telemetry, and Med/Surg patients, but not affiliated clinics or outpatient department patients.\n",
    "* ICU COVID-19 Positive Patients: Number of laboratory-confirmed positive COVID-19 patients that are in hospital ICUs TODAY.  This is not a cumulative number.\n",
    "* ICU COVID-19 Suspected Patients: Number of symptomatic patients, with tests for COVID-19 pending laboratory confirmation, that are in hospital ICUs TODAY.  The dashboard also reports difference and percentage change, compared to the prior day.\n",

    "We can safely assume that for the named counties, all `NaN` values can be replaced by 0. For instance, in the time between 4/1/2020 and 4/8/2020, Alpine and Sierra Counties experienced no change in total cases/deaths, so the number of in-hospital patients would probably stay at 0. Sutter County saw its cases rise steadily, but there were no lab-confirmed hospital cases, implying that the new cases were non-hospital patients. Glenn County only has missing entries for 4/1/2020, the first day of reporting, and with only 2 confirmed cases, it's likely that those patients contracted COVID-19 before that day and thus were not part of the hospitals' daily count. Finally, since we are focusing on the county-by-county perspective, we will ignore those cases that went unassigned. We then clean our data as follows, making sure no more missing data remains:"
